`declaring a mutable variable
`bnf is <id> ':' <data type>
`# is the <new> operator, which is mandatory
# x : int 
# y : char


`assigning values to mutable variable
`bnf is <value> '>>' <id>
5 >> x `store 5 into x
x >> y `store value of x into y

`declaring an immutable variable
`bnf is <id> ':' <value>
 pi : 3.1415 
 name_of_president : 'obama'
 
 
`declaring an assigning to a mutable variable at the same time 
`statically
5 >> # x : int 

`dynamically
5 >> # y  `this has an issue, as the type of 'y' should be 'int' or 'num' ?
